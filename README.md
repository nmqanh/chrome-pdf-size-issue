# Context

At the moment PDF generated by Chrome does not have size precision despite whatever unit you put into it
E.g. In the example code, we are just generating a simple `75mm x 55mm` or `7.5cm x 5.5cm` PDF but Chrome is producing `74.8mm x 54.7mm` PDF.

# How to test

1. Run the example script

	```javascript
	npm install
	node index.js
	```
2. Use Adobe Acrobat or simimar PDF reader software, go to File -> Properties to check the PDF file size.
3. It's expected the file size to be `75mm x 55mm` but it is not.
